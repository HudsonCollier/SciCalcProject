* Project Overview
This project is a Python application that provides both a standard calculator and a scientific calculator within a graphical user interface (GUI) created using Tkinter. The standard calculator includes basic arithmetic operations, while the scientific calculator extends the functionality with various mathematical and trigonometric functions.

Features
Basic Calculator
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Percentage calculation.
Change sign of numbers.
Clear entry.
Scientific Calculator
Square, cube, and nth root calculations.
Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan) and their inverses.
Hyperbolic trigonometric functions (sinh, cosh).
Exponentiation (e^x, 2^x, 10^x).
Natural logarithm (ln) and base-10 logarithm (log10).
Factorial calculation.
Random number generation.
Constants like Ï€ and e.
Error handling for invalid input.
Usage
Scientific Calculator
Run the program.
In the main window, click on the "View" menu and select "Scientific" to switch to the scientific calculator.
Use the scientific calculator to perform advanced mathematical operations.
Normal Calculator
Run the program.
The standard calculator is the default view.
Use the standard calculator to perform basic arithmetic operations.
Dependencies
This project uses the following Python libraries:

Tkinter: The standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
